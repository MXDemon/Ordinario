<h4>Tracer Time Space Jump Glitch Tutorial!</h4>

    With a unique ability to control the speed of her own passage through time, Tracer zips and blinks around the battlefield, 
    eluding attackers and sneaking past defenses. A perfect skirmisher hero, Tracer is fragile but hard to hit, keeping one step ahead of her attackers while
    she harasses and harries the enemy team. Tracer excels at getting behind enemy lines, but it is inadvisable to move her through chokepoints. Should she 
    find herself blinking into an ambush, she can rewind time to her position and state a few seconds earlier, giving her a second chance.

The developers consider Tracer to have one of the most unique play styles in Overwatch.

<h4>Reinhart Infinite Shield Bug</h4>

   <p style = "color: white; margin:20px;"> 
   Over thirty years ago, Overwatch was founded to counter the threat of the robot uprisings around the world. Reinhardt, a highly decorated German soldier,
  was inducted as part of the original Overwatch strike team that put an end to the Omnic Crisis. After the conflict's resolution, Overwatch grew into a global 
  institution, keeping the peace in a war-torn world. Reinhardt proved himself to be one of its most stalwart champions.

  Reinhardt's unique ethics and larger-than-life persona earned the admiration of his peers and superiors alike. Never 
  afraid to speak his mind, he was Overwatch's most vocal supporter and, when necessary, its harshest critic, providing a constant reminder that Overwatch was
  meant to be a force for good.[3] He got on well with Torbjörn (who maintained his armor). Seven years before the present day, Reinhardt was part of an unsanctioned 
  mission authorized by Strike Commander Jack Morrison to end the Kings Row Uprising in London, England. While preparing to board an aircraft, Reinhardt welcomed the team's 
  newest member, Lena Oxton, to the team.[6]
At some point he was stationed at Watchpoint: Gibraltar, where he got a tan.</p>

<h4>Bustio! Take a look of the new Lucio Tecniques</h4>

Lúcio Correia dos Santos grew up in Rio de Janeiro, in a poor and crowded favela that was hit hard by the financial upheaval following the Omnic Crisis.[2] During his youth, 
     Lúcio's first love was hockey, but he also found time to play football with the other kids in Rio.[3] As Brazil began the long process of recovery, Lúcio wanted to find 
     a way to lift the spirits of those around him. He found his answer in music and its power to bring people together and even help them forget their troubles, if only for 
     a short time. He performed on street corners, in block parties, and as he got older, at a string of legendary underground shows.

But Lúcio's close-knit community was thrown into chaos when the multinational Vishkar Corporation secured a contract to redevelop large tracts of the city. Lúcio and his neighbors
     had been told that the development would improve their lives. However, that promise never became a reality. Vishkar imposed controls on the residents in the name of building a
     more orderly society: enforcing curfews, cracking down on what the company perceived as lawless behavior, and exploiting the populace as a cheap labor force.

Lúcio wouldn't stand for it. He stole Vishkar sonic technology that had been used to suppress the people, and he converted it into a tool to rally them to action. In a popular 
     uprising, they drove Vishkar out of their neighborhoods. Lúcio's leadership made him a star overnight and a symbol for positive social change. His music skyrocketed in popularity.
     Whereas he had once performed locally, he was now filling arenas across the world.[2] He built up a career doing live shows, and became something of a national icon in Brazil.</p>
